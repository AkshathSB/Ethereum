# Creating a Token

This is a Solidity program that creates a token which then can be minted and burnt. 

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions mint and burn where the mint function adds inputted value(token) to your account and the burn function does removes values from your account. This program helps me to understand the basic coding elements of Solidity such has creating user-defined functions and understanding the language. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Token.sol). 

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.20" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the  "mint" and "burn" functions. Click on the "Token" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint" & "deploy" function and enter the required inputs (address, uint-value) . Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the functions.
